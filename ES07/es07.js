// Ecma Script 07 which was introduced in 2016

// It has added some of the features like,

// 1) Exponential operator

let cube = 2 ** 3;
console.log(cube); // Output: 8

// 2) includes method in Arrays (Arrays.prototype.includes)

let arr = [20,19,34,26,"Hello"];

console.log(arr.includes("Hello")); // Output: true
